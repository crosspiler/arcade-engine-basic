GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT: PATH TO POWER (Political Conquest)

1. CONCEPT
   - Genre: Strategy / RPG / Simulation
   - Theme: Rise from poverty to political supremacy.
   - Inspiration: Shadow of War (Nemesis System), Crusader Kings (Intrigue).

2. PLAYER CHARACTER
   - Starts as: "The Nobody" (Weak, Poor, Unknown).
   - Stats:
     - Influence (Mana): Used for speech, recruiting, swaying crowds.
     - Wealth (Gold): Used for bribes, hiring mercenaries, buying gear.
     - Notoriety (Heat): How much the current rulers want you dead. High notoriety = harder defenses but more fear.
     - Power (Strength): Combat ability and force.

3. THE WORLD (Grid Based)
   - The map is divided into "Districts" or "Forts".
   - Each District is controlled by a procedurally generated "Leader" (The Nemesis).
   - Districts have:
     - Population (Health of the district).
     - Loyalty (Resistance to capture).
     - Wealth (Reward for capture).
     - Defense (Difficulty of forceful takeover).

4. GAMEPLAY LOOP
   
   PHASE 1: INFILTRATION (The Grind)
   - Move around the grid to find "Nodes" of interest (Taverns, Guard Posts, Markets).
   - Perform minor actions to build stats:
     - "Beg/Work" -> +Wealth
     - "Orate" -> +Influence
     - "Petty Crime" -> +Wealth, +Notoriety

   PHASE 2: DESTABILIZATION (The Attack)
   - Target the District Leader's assets (Lieutenants, Supply lines).
   - Select Action Type:
     A. BRIBE: Pay Wealth to remove a Lieutenant or lower District Defense.
     B. TRAP: Set up a scandal or physical trap. Lowers Leader Strength.
     C. INFLUENCE: Use Charisma/Followers to convert population. Lowers Loyalty.
     D. HUMILIATE: Publicly defeat a Lieutenant. Massive Influence gain, lowers Leader Morale.
     E. KILL: Assassinate a target. High Notoriety gain. Removes obstacle permanently but might be replaced by someone worse.
     F. RECRUIT: Turn a Lieutenant to your side. They provide passive bonuses.

   PHASE 3: THE COUP (Fort Capture)
   - Trigger the final confrontation for the District.
   - Success: You become the District Leader. Gain passive income/influence.
   - Failure: You are injured/imprisoned. Lose stats or time. Nemesis grows stronger.

5. PROCEDURAL STORYTELLING
   - Leaders have traits (e.g., "Greedy", "Paranoid", "Honorable").
   - Actions generate log entries:
     "You tried to Bribe Captain X, but his 'Honorable' trait caused him to attack you!"
     "You Humiliated the Mayor. He now has the 'Broken' trait."

6. PROGRESSION
   - Capture all districts to win.
   - As you grow, the "State" sends stronger agents against you.
