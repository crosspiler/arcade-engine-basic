# Arcade Engine Babylon

This project is a new game engine built with Babylon.js to be more flexible and support a wider variety of games.
It was created to replace the old grid-based engine.

## Sheep-Fight Game

To demonstrate the new engine, a "sheep-fight" game was created.
In this game, you control a sheep and have to knock other sheep off the arena.

### How to run the game

1.  Navigate to the `arcade-engine-babylon` directory.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` (or the address shown in the terminal).

### Controls

-   **W, A, S, D**: Move the sheep.
